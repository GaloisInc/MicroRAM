Week Apr 17:

- Register allocation: Can the compiler decide teh number of registers?
  Since the architecture is fictional, can we parametrise it and let the
  compiler/static analysis decide on those parameters.
  Based on static analysis the parameters reveal no extra information that is not readily available. Right?

- TinyRAM condition flag: good optimization but wasted if compiling frm LLVM that already stores teh "flag" in registers. Do we want a compiler pass to find these flags and lift them unto the real flag?
