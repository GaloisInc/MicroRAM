# MicroRAM
 
 This is a toy experiment containing:
 
 * An implementation of TinyRAM 
 * A interpreter of TinyRAM in Haskell 
 * A compiler from LLVM to TinyRAM
 * A compiler from TinyRAM to Non deterministic circuit (not built yet)
 
 The entire project is meant as an exercise for me to learn Haskell, TinyRAM, LLVM and SNARK circuits.
